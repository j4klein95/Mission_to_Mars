# Mission_to_Mars
##Web Scraping project

### Mission:
* This project uses MongoDB(Flask_pymongo), Heroku, Flask, pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, splinter, and selenium webdriver to scrape data on Mars.
* Goal is to scrape data on Mars, have a flask app which  scrapes the data, then put the info into a MongoDB where the Flask app will render an html.
* This app will be deployed to Heroku.

### Run without Heroku:
1. Copy/gather the files in this repo (don't need the .gitignore).
2. Start a MongoDB daemon in the terminal, then start mongo instance.
3. Run the app.py in the terminal. Copy the local url to your web browser.

#### Things to fix:
* Jan 3: App is not rendering hemisphere images. Will ask for some assistance.
